> **Note**: This tutorial is currently available to only demonstrate early iOS support for the Unreal GDK. We do not yet recommend that you use it to develop iOS games. For information about the alpha version of mobile development support, follow our[ development roadmap](https://github.com/spatialos/UnrealGDK/projects/1) and[ Unreal features support](https://docs.improbable.io/unreal/alpha/unreal-features-support) pages.

In this tutorial, you'll learn about the following steps to develop game for iOS devices using the Unreal GDK:
1. Get started: Get the dependencies for developing iOS games and ensure that you meet all the device and software requirements.
2. Set up iOS support: Check out the iOS branch of Unreal GDK and get your Apple Developer certificates setup to work with your Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) project.
3. Set up development environment: 
    *   On Windows: Set up a remote build of Unreal Engine: Remotely compile on a Mac from a Windows machine to create an iOS build.
    *   On MacOS: Check out the MacOS branch of Unreal GDK and run the game locally.
4. Connect to a local deployment: Set up the local connection for the iOS client, launch a local deployment, and connect the iOS client to the deployment.
5. Connect to a cloud deployment: Connect a game client to the cloud deployment and connect an UnrealServer worker to the cloud deployment.

**> Note**: The preceding development workflows are still in the early stage, and there will be constant improvements to them. 

After you complete the tutorial, you should be able to connect your game to your local or cloud deployment for testing.
